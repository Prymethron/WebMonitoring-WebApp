# WebMonitoring-WebApp
It's a Web Monitoring web-app. Sends request to web sites and gets a response that brings how long did it take and status code. Holds all datas in a postgresql database.
While Monitoring.py is running, every hour it sends request and every 24 hours it deletes all datas from the database.
# Required Libs
Flask\
Prefect\
Postgresql
# Prerequisites
For now on this version you have to create database and tables manually.\
